Next steps:
1. add a has_legal_move in the Board class, which determins if there's 
any legal moves for the current player
-> Brutal Force way: for all set not in the on_board set, add to check it's flips 

2. correspondingly, modify game_controller so that when there's no
legal move for the current player, switch to the next player

3. write the name and score to a file named "scores.txt"
