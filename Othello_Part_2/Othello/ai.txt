Strategies for AI:
The AI mainly takes three strategies:
1. occupy corner strategies: if any of the four corner can be occupied, occupy
it
2. greedy strategy: place a tile at the position which leads to the most 
flips
3. corner protection strategy: don't place a tile at the surrounding positions
of the corners if there's any other position to fill. This strategy is embedded
within the greedy strategy

There are priorities for these strategies: the occupy corner strategy always 
comes first, corner protection strategy comes second, and greedy strategy will 
be applied if neither of the above two applies. 

I would say you cannot beat this AI if you just pick a move randomly

I think the AI can be improved by two ways:
1. Use action points, that is, the total amount of moves a player/AI can
have as a measurement of a move. The aim of the AI is to limit the opponent's 
action points as low as possible.
2. Add a predict function: that is, place a tile at aby possible position and 
make a simulation of possible opponent actions. After analyzing all possible 
actions, choose the move that the opponent will have the least action points
